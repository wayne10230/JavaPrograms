"how to calculate the minimum value of an Array"

First create an array then create one with absolute value. Compare the abosalute values by initililizing a new variable that gets updated 
everytime a number in the array better fits its condition. Than in order to diffrientiate two absolute values with the same values
while with the absolute values, create an if statement that adds 0.1 to wutever value lower than 0. Then create a vraible that'll represent 
the position of the smallest number. This will then be used to print out the actual value. Use the for loop to monitor the amount of temperature 
the user has input.
