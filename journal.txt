I wrote a program that converts binary to unary. The way I did it is through a series of if statement. The program starts 
with a for loop so that the program can read the number in the String. Aftr that since binary are only in 1 and 0, I can use
if statements to determine how many zeroes (uniary) to add. However, need to be becareful of adding a 0 to the original 
conversion since the way I did it doesn't count the original number. (HW convert unary to binary)
