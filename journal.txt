I wrote a program that converts binary to unary. The way I did it is through a series of if statement. The program starts 
with a for loop so that the program can read the number in the String. Aftr that since binary are only in 1 and 0, I can use
if statements to determine how many zeroes (uniary) to add. However, need to be becareful of adding a 0 to the original 
conversion since the way I did it doesn't count the original number. (HW convert unary to binary)

Tried to convert unary back to binary. The first step is to split the unary code base on spaces, so the program can detect 
whether it's 00 or 0, which is either 1 or 0. The rest can be use to determine the number of the the specific type. The conversion
is stored in a variable using the += method.

Tried to cnvert binary to Ascci, whcih invovles creating an rray with a storage space of 7 due to the fact that an array starts at 
position 0 and there're actually 8 binary numbers per ascii letter. To split the string, we have to use a method that requires the input
of the starting and ending position, which in my case uses a variable that holds seven that is multiplied by the amount required to 
advance to the next Ascii letter. Also tried the GTO 13 secret message which changes the letter in the current message into
letter that is 13 units away in the alphabet. First convert the message into integer, then add 13 then convert it back to character.

Pratice with array by locating the nearest the defib from a given user location. The programs uses a for-loop to update the position
of in which the loop has to be read and updated. To get the distance, I used a 2 formulas to get the x and y coordinate than use
the distance formla to get the actually distance. Also, I learned to convert spaces to actually spaces by using the .replace method whihc
replaces a certain data within a string to a desired one.
