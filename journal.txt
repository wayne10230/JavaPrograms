"how to calculate the minimum value of an Array"

First create an array then create one with absolute value. Compare the abosalute values by initililizing a new variable that gets updated 
everytime a number in the array better fits its condition. Than in order to diffrientiate two absolute values with the same values
while with the absolute values, create an if statement that adds 0.1 to wutever value lower than 0. Then create a vraible that'll represent 
the position of the smallest number. This will then be used to print out the actual value. Use the for loop to monitor the amount of temperature 
the user has input.


Using if statements to move thor. The movement is determined by comparing thor's spawn coordinates to the destination's coordinates. So if the 
the x coordinate of Thor is greater than the x coordinate of the destination, the heading of thor on the x axis is determined. To encode unary, the code 
has to firts be converted to binary, where 1 equals to 0 and 0 equals to 00; with that as the heading, the amount of numbers in the block determines the amount 
of 0 within the unary code. So if the block has 111, it'll print out 000. And the block can only extends and contain the same number.

A function is a method to import a sub-program(? under public static) into another program. One should use such method because sometimes its makes it easier
for the programmer to identify each line's function without all the lines; another use is that it simply imports lines. To create a program that translate decimal 
into binary, one has to use the divide and % functions to replicate the on-paper way of translation. However, since one has to read the remainder backwards to get the
binary code, the programmer can use the StringBuffer class to convert the binary string backwards. After that, convert it back to string using the .to(forgot) method in 
a print line statement.
